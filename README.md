# TAMU Hackathon 2020:

###### Projects:
Gartner Chatbot
Google API

###### Objective:
Create FoodieBot using Google Dialogflow API and basic Javascript.

###### Learning Outcomes:
**Dialogflow:** Based on two main concepts, intent and context.
**Intent:** Accurately identify the purpose of the sentence that the user has sent to the bot
**Context:** Give coherence and fluency to the discussion, preserving the key concepts that have already been used in the conversation.
**Entities:** Allow you to identify common or parametrically recurring concepts in the discussion.

###### Difficulties:
We spent a lot of time on understanding how the Dialogflow API worked and how to integrate it through Javascript.

###### Conclusion:
I learned a lot about what an API is and got to learn and work with the basics of Javascript. This was overall a great learning experience.
